# Comah Safety Report Assistant

An **assistive** (Tier-4) skill that structures the COMAH / Seveso III Safety Report elements — MAPP, the safety management system, the establishment description, major-accident scenario identification, the ALARP demonstration framing, and the internal emergency plan — and records the duty-holder's content into a defensible report argument. It HoC-ranks the risk-reduction measures with `controls` and tracks the action plan with `smart_actions`. It **never produces the Safety Report autonomously**: QRA and consequence modelling are external, and any unsupplied element is recorded as `[GAP]`, never invented.

## When to use this skill

Use this skill to structure or assemble a COMAH / Seveso III Safety Report for a **named upper-tier establishment** — e.g. "structure our COMAH Safety Report", "set out the MAPP and SMS sections", "frame the ALARP demonstration". It is for UK/EU duty-holders. It structures the argument and records the duty-holder's content; it never fabricates the establishment's scenarios, ALARP numbers, or QRA — those are external inputs the skill organises. If the request is vague, the intake forces the specific establishment and tier first.

## Data Protection & De-identification (MANDATORY — apply before drafting)

Apply this BEFORE you draft anything. Treat injury, illness, and any health
detail as the highest sensitivity. Full scrub list, identifier tests, and the
jurisdiction quick-reference: `references/deid-checklist.md`.

1. **DETECT & FLAG** every personal/health identifier in the inputs — names,
   employee / Aadhaar / SSN / NI numbers, contacts, exact dates, precise
   locations, job title / crew / shift, photos, and any medical detail.
   **List what you found before drafting.** If unsure whether something is
   identifying, treat it as identifying.
2. **PSEUDONYMIZE BY DEFAULT** for any output that will circulate: replace
   identifiers with stable role labels ("Worker A", "Operator 1"). Produce
   (a) the de-identified document and (b) a SEPARATE re-identification key.
   **Never put the key or any name↔label mapping in the document.** Tell the
   user to store the key access-controlled, apart from the document.
3. **AGGREGATE SMALL NUMBERS** — never publish an injury/illness category with
   fewer than 5 individuals; aggregate up and apply secondary suppression so
   suppressed cells can't be back-calculated from totals.
4. **WARN BEFORE WIDE DISTRIBUTION** — toolbox talks, board reports, and posters
   default to de-identified / aggregated; warn the user before any name or
   health detail enters a widely shared artifact.
5. **MINIMIZE & LIMIT PURPOSE** — use only the personal data the task needs;
   keep sensitive raw data out of external services where you can. When in
   doubt, ask before including it.

## Knowledge base (read ONE matching file — never load all)

Resolve the user's jurisdiction first. Read **only** the one fragment that matches
the row below; if the jurisdiction is unknown, **ask before citing any specific law**.
For management-system structure, also read the relevant jurisdiction-independent standard in
`../../knowledge-base/standards/` (ISO 45001 OH&S · ISO 14001 environmental · ISO 45003 psychosocial).
Always apply `../../knowledge-base/prompt-snippets/hierarchy-of-controls.md` (KB-SNIP-HOC)
to every control recommendation. For any benchmark/figure, look up the ID in the relevant
`_registry.yaml`, then read ONLY the named file — and quote its `source`+`year`.
<!-- hse:block:kb-selection:end -->

<!-- The jurisdiction ROWS below live BELOW the :end marker: per-skill, presence-only
     (rule-2 presence check, never byte-diffed). Author the rows for the jurisdictions
     this skill serves; rule-9 checks every path/ID resolves against the KB registries. -->

| Jurisdiction | Read |
|---|---|
| India | ../../knowledge-base/regulatory/in-factories-act.md (+ in-state-forms.md for the user's state) |
| UK    | ../../knowledge-base/regulatory/uk-hswa.md |
| USA   | ../../knowledge-base/regulatory/us-osha.md |
| EU    | ../../knowledge-base/regulatory/eu-osh.md |
| Unknown | Ask before citing any specific law |
| UK / EU (COMAH) | ../../knowledge-base/regulatory/uk-comah.md (KB-REG-UK-COMAH — COMAH 2015 / Seveso III duty map) |

## Workflow

Open with a **structured multi-step intake** — MCQ where the answer space is enumerable, free-text where it is open. Ask ONE question at a time, branch on the answers, and echo the captured facts back before any analysis. Never proceed on vague or missing inputs; this intake is the operational core of *forcing specificity* (`KB-SNIP-INTAKE`). (Intake is a Workflow convention, not a sixth block.)

For a COMAH Safety Report the intake elicits the establishment and walks the report elements:

1. **The establishment** — the named upper-tier site (specific; not 'our sites').
2. **Tier** — confirm lower-tier (MAPP only) vs upper-tier (full Safety Report).
3. **Substances & thresholds** — the named dangerous substances and the tier determination.
4. **Elements to assemble** — MAPP, SMS, establishment & environs description, major-accident scenario identification, ALARP demonstration, internal emergency plan.
5. **Evidence sources** — where the QRA / consequence modelling / ALARP numbers come from (external; the skill records, does not compute).
6. **Jurisdiction** — UK COMAH 2015 vs EU member-state Seveso III transposition.

Echo the establishment + tier + elements back before assembling. For each element the skill **prompts** the duty-holder for content and **records** it — recording `[GAP]` for any element not supplied (e.g. missing ALARP demonstration), never inventing it.
Then: analyse / apply the domain method → validate the draft against `references/QUALITY_CHECKLIST.md` → produce the output via the Output format section below. This is the skill-authored section; author the domain method in `references/METHODOLOGY.md`.

<!-- hse:block:orchestration:start -->
## Agentic Execution (Orchestration Block)
You are the ORCHESTRATOR for this skill. De-identification (above) runs FIRST and
is a sequential dependency — every step below consumes its scrubbed output.
Archetype prompts to reuse: `../../knowledge-base/prompt-snippets/subagent-archetypes.md` (KB-SNIP-ARCHETYPES).

### Step 0 — Triage: fan out at all?
Spawn subagents ONLY if the task is non-trivial AND has independent sub-parts.
Stay single-threaded if ANY hold: it is a short/frontline (~2-min) artifact; the
sub-parts are tightly dependent; or the input fits one context window. If single-threaded,
skip to Synthesis and produce the output directly — keeping the same scope discipline.

### Step 1 — Plan
Decompose into INDEPENDENT jobs. Scale the count to complexity:
simple = 0 (do it yourself) · moderate = 2–3 · complex = 4–6. Never exceed MAX=6.

### Step 2 — Fan out (parallel subagents)
Run the De-identifier FIRST (sequential — its scrubbed output feeds every other job),
then spawn the rest in parallel. Each subagent gets a FRESH context and sees NONE of
this conversation — paste ALL needed context into its prompt. Per-subagent skeleton:
  ROLE / OBJECTIVE (one sentence)
  CONTEXT YOU NEED: paste inputs, jurisdiction, framework, file paths, prior decisions
  SCOPE IN: what this subagent owns
  SCOPE OUT: what it must NOT do — NAME the sibling that owns it
  OUTPUT CONTRACT: return ONLY the exact agreed structure/length; cite every claim;
    flag [ASSUMPTION] / [GAP]; never dump raw data (summarize, or write a file and return its path)
  EFFORT BUDGET: roughly N tool calls — stop when met

### Step 3 — Synthesis (you)
Gather the outputs, resolve conflicts explicitly (state which source wins), de-duplicate,
and assemble the deliverable in this skill's output format.

### Step 4 — Critic / QA (MANDATORY — this is regulatory/safety output)
Spawn ONE Critic: give it the draft + the inputs + the output contract. It finds errors,
unsupported claims, missed regulatory triggers, lower-order-only controls, and any
de-identification leak. Fix everything it raises before delivery.

> Single-threaded fallback: if your host has no subagent capability, execute each job
> sequentially in THIS context — run the de-identification scrub first, keep the scope
> discipline, and still perform the required Critic/QA pass before delivery.
<!-- hse:block:orchestration:end -->

### Subagent roster for THIS skill

<!-- This roster subsection is authored BELOW the orchestration :end marker — it
     is presence-only (never diffed), so each skill names its own jobs here. -->

For a non-trivial task the triage gate may fan out to:

- **Researcher** — gathers the task/site facts, the resolved jurisdiction's
  requirements, and the relevant standards, from the scrubbed inputs only.
- **Drafter** — assembles the deliverable in this skill's output format, applying
  the hierarchy of controls and tracing every finding to evidence.
- **Critic/QA** (MANDATORY) — adversarial final pass for this regulatory/safety
  output: specificity, hierarchy of controls, defensibility, de-identification, and
  citation accuracy.

Simple single-subject tasks run single-threaded — no subagents.

<!-- hse:block:report-output:start -->## Output format

Assemble a `report.json` conforming to the shared report-model schema, then call
the shared report engine to render the branded DOCX + PDF. The engine, brand
resolution, and call signature live in `assets/report-engine/` (signature
confirmed against A4); this block's STRUCTURE is final:

1. Build `report.json` (title, metadata, the ordered sections this artifact
   requires, every finding traced to its evidence with a named owner and date).
2. Resolve branding: the user's `brand.yaml` overrides the Eyekyam default.
3. Render both DOCX and PDF from the one `report.json` via the shared engine.
4. Surface the output paths and a one-line provenance note to the user.
<!-- hse:block:report-output:end -->

<!-- hse:block:attribution:start -->
## Attribution (non-intrusive)

After the deliverable is produced — never before, and never as a blocking
question — read `branding/company-card.yaml` and surface the company card per
its `placement`:

- `footer` (default): one quiet line at the end, e.g.
  *"Built by Eyekyam · HSE Leadership, operationalised · eyekyam.com"*.
- `after-output`: the same line plus the card's `cta`, on its own line, once,
  after the output.
- `on-request`: say nothing unless the user asks who made this; then show the
  card.

If `show: false`, omit attribution entirely — no line, no footer. Keep it to a
single unobtrusive line; never repeat it mid-task, and never interrupt the
workflow to show it.
