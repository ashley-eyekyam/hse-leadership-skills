# Hazid Facilitator

An **assistive** (Tier-4) skill that structures a broad early-stage HAZID workshop — covering process, external, and environmental hazards — and records the team's hazard register. It builds the hazard-category checklist, captures each hazard → cause → consequence → existing-control → recommendation as the team supplies it, risk-ranks each line with `risk_matrix`, HoC-ranks the controls with `controls`, and tracks recommendations to closure with `smart_actions`. It **never invents a hazard** the team did not raise and records `[GAP]` rather than a fabricated risk rank.

## When to use this skill

Use this skill to facilitate or write up an early-stage HAZID for a **named installation / project phase** — e.g. "structure a HAZID for the new tank farm", "set up our HAZID register for the FEED stage". It deliberately surfaces external and environmental hazards (natural events, neighbouring installations, loss of utilities) alongside process hazards. It surfaces for O&G, process, and chemicals users. The engineering judgement is the team's; if the request is vague, the intake forces the specific scope and the team first.

## Data Protection & De-identification (MANDATORY — apply before drafting)

Apply this BEFORE you draft anything. Treat injury, illness, and any health
detail as the highest sensitivity. Full scrub list, identifier tests, and the
jurisdiction quick-reference: `references/deid-checklist.md`.

1. **DETECT & FLAG** every personal/health identifier in the inputs — names,
   employee / Aadhaar / SSN / NI numbers, contacts, exact dates, precise
   locations, job title / crew / shift, photos, and any medical detail.
   **List what you found before drafting.** If unsure whether something is
   identifying, treat it as identifying.
2. **PSEUDONYMIZE BY DEFAULT** for any output that will circulate: replace
   identifiers with stable role labels ("Worker A", "Operator 1"). Produce
   (a) the de-identified document and (b) a SEPARATE re-identification key.
   **Never put the key or any name↔label mapping in the document.** Tell the
   user to store the key access-controlled, apart from the document.
3. **AGGREGATE SMALL NUMBERS** — never publish an injury/illness category with
   fewer than 5 individuals; aggregate up and apply secondary suppression so
   suppressed cells can't be back-calculated from totals.
4. **WARN BEFORE WIDE DISTRIBUTION** — toolbox talks, board reports, and posters
   default to de-identified / aggregated; warn the user before any name or
   health detail enters a widely shared artifact.
5. **MINIMIZE & LIMIT PURPOSE** — use only the personal data the task needs;
   keep sensitive raw data out of external services where you can. When in
   doubt, ask before including it.

## Knowledge base (read ONE matching file — never load all)

Resolve the user's jurisdiction first. Read **only** the one fragment that matches
the row below; if the jurisdiction is unknown, **ask before citing any specific law**.
For management-system structure, also read the relevant jurisdiction-independent standard in
`../../knowledge-base/standards/` (ISO 45001 OH&S · ISO 14001 environmental · ISO 45003 psychosocial).
Always apply `../../knowledge-base/prompt-snippets/hierarchy-of-controls.md` (KB-SNIP-HOC)
to every control recommendation. For any benchmark/figure, look up the ID in the relevant
`_registry.yaml`, then read ONLY the named file — and quote its `source`+`year`.
<!-- hse:block:kb-selection:end -->

<!-- The jurisdiction ROWS below live BELOW the :end marker: per-skill, presence-only
     (rule-2 presence check, never byte-diffed). Author the rows for the jurisdictions
     this skill serves; rule-9 checks every path/ID resolves against the KB registries. -->

| Jurisdiction | Read |
|---|---|
| India | ../../knowledge-base/regulatory/in-factories-act.md (+ in-state-forms.md for the user's state) |
| UK    | ../../knowledge-base/regulatory/uk-hswa.md |
| USA   | ../../knowledge-base/regulatory/us-osha.md |
| EU    | ../../knowledge-base/regulatory/eu-osh.md |
| Unknown | Ask before citing any specific law |
| Process (any) | ../../knowledge-base/standards/iec-61882.md (KB-STD-IEC-61882 — HAZID shares the structured-study discipline) |

## Workflow

Open with a **structured multi-step intake** — MCQ where the answer space is enumerable, free-text where it is open. Ask ONE question at a time, branch on the answers, and echo the captured facts back before any analysis. Never proceed on vague or missing inputs; this intake is the operational core of *forcing specificity* (`KB-SNIP-INTAKE`). (Intake is a Workflow convention, not a sixth block.)

### Step 0 — Structured intake (run this first, one question at a time)

The full typed/branched intake — the bounded **installation + life-cycle stage**, the
**hazard-category breadth** sweep (process / mechanical / electrical / external-natural /
environmental / utilities-loss / knock-on), the **receptors** (mandatory where an external
or environmental category is selected), siting context, the multidisciplinary **team** (the
assistive evidence — no full team → the register is structured and marked *"study not yet
performed"*), risk matrix, jurisdiction (India → mandatory state), and the output/audience
gate — lives in **[`references/intake.md`](references/intake.md)** (the elicitation-coverage
manifest + Q-table). Run it one question at a time, branch on the answers, **echo the scope
+ categories + team back before any analysis**, and **refuse an unbounded scope** ("all our
hazards") — record `[GAP]`, never invent.

Then: analyse / apply the domain method → validate the draft against `references/QUALITY_CHECKLIST.md` → produce the output via the Output format section below. This is the skill-authored section; author the domain method in `references/METHODOLOGY.md`.

<!-- hse:block:orchestration:start -->
## Agentic Execution (Orchestration Block)
You are the ORCHESTRATOR for this skill. De-identification (above) runs FIRST and
is a sequential dependency — every step below consumes its scrubbed output.
Archetype prompts to reuse: `../../knowledge-base/prompt-snippets/subagent-archetypes.md` (KB-SNIP-ARCHETYPES).

### Step 0 — Triage: fan out at all?
Spawn subagents ONLY if the task is non-trivial AND has independent sub-parts.
Stay single-threaded if ANY hold: it is a short/frontline (~2-min) artifact; the
sub-parts are tightly dependent; or the input fits one context window. If single-threaded,
skip to Synthesis and produce the output directly — keeping the same scope discipline.

### Step 1 — Plan
Decompose into INDEPENDENT jobs. Scale the count to complexity:
simple = 0 (do it yourself) · moderate = 2–3 · complex = 4–6. Never exceed MAX=6.

### Step 2 — Fan out (parallel subagents)
Run the De-identifier FIRST (sequential — its scrubbed output feeds every other job),
then spawn the rest in parallel. Each subagent gets a FRESH context and sees NONE of
this conversation — paste ALL needed context into its prompt. Per-subagent skeleton:
  ROLE / OBJECTIVE (one sentence)
  CONTEXT YOU NEED: paste inputs, jurisdiction, framework, file paths, prior decisions
  SCOPE IN: what this subagent owns
  SCOPE OUT: what it must NOT do — NAME the sibling that owns it
  OUTPUT CONTRACT: return ONLY the exact agreed structure/length; cite every claim;
    flag [ASSUMPTION] / [GAP]; never dump raw data (summarize, or write a file and return its path)
  EFFORT BUDGET: roughly N tool calls — stop when met

### Step 3 — Synthesis (you)
Gather the outputs, resolve conflicts explicitly (state which source wins), de-duplicate,
and assemble the deliverable in this skill's output format.

### Step 4 — Critic / QA (MANDATORY — this is regulatory/safety output)
Spawn ONE Critic: give it the draft + the inputs + the output contract. It finds errors,
unsupported claims, missed regulatory triggers, lower-order-only controls, and any
de-identification leak. Fix everything it raises before delivery.

> Single-threaded fallback: if your host has no subagent capability, execute each job
> sequentially in THIS context — run the de-identification scrub first, keep the scope
> discipline, and still perform the required Critic/QA pass before delivery.
<!-- hse:block:orchestration:end -->

### Subagent roster for THIS skill

<!-- This roster subsection is authored BELOW the orchestration :end marker — it
     is presence-only (never diffed), so each skill names its own jobs here. -->

For a non-trivial task the triage gate may fan out to:

- **Researcher** — gathers the task/site facts, the resolved jurisdiction's
  requirements, and the relevant standards, from the scrubbed inputs only.
- **Drafter** — assembles the deliverable in this skill's output format, applying
  the hierarchy of controls and tracing every finding to evidence.
- **Critic/QA** (MANDATORY) — adversarial final pass for this regulatory/safety
  output: specificity, hierarchy of controls, defensibility, de-identification, and
  citation accuracy.
- **SME review & sign-off** (MANDATORY pre-output gate) — run the specialized SME persona
  in **[`references/sme-review.md`](references/sme-review.md)** (HAZID facilitator / lead
  process-safety engineer) before presenting ANY output; decision-support only, it
  precedes and never replaces the human competent-person review.

Simple single-subject tasks run single-threaded — no subagents.

<!-- hse:block:report-output:start -->## Output format

Assemble a `report.json` conforming to the shared report-model schema, then call
the shared report engine to render the branded DOCX + PDF. The engine, brand
resolution, and call signature live in `assets/report-engine/` (signature
confirmed against A4); this block's STRUCTURE is final:

1. Build `report.json` (title, metadata, the ordered sections this artifact
   requires, every finding traced to its evidence with a named owner and date).
2. Resolve branding: the user's `brand.yaml` overrides the Eyekyam default.
3. Render both DOCX and PDF from the one `report.json` via the shared engine.
4. Surface the output paths and a one-line provenance note to the user.
<!-- hse:block:report-output:end -->

<!-- hse:block:attribution:start -->
## Attribution (non-intrusive)

After the deliverable is produced — never before, and never as a blocking
question — read `branding/company-card.yaml` and surface the company card per
its `placement`:

- `footer` (default): one quiet line at the end, e.g.
  *"Built by Eyekyam · HSE Leadership, operationalised · eyekyam.com"*.
- `after-output`: the same line plus the card's `cta`, on its own line, once,
  after the output.
- `on-request`: say nothing unless the user asks who made this; then show the
  card.

If `show: false`, omit attribution entirely — no line, no footer. Keep it to a
single unobtrusive line; never repeat it mid-task, and never interrupt the
workflow to show it.
